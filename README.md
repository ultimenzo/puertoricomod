# puertoricomod

Just a small mod I made a few months ago. It adds a focus tree for Puerto Rico and a generic one similar to the baltic tree to all Caribbean nations.
By Caribbean nations I mean all nations that have a coast in the Caribbean Sea or are island nations in it.

This includes: (If they are not a starting nation, than they will not have the focus tree but may be cored by the Caribbean Union path)
1. Central America (El Salvador included for border's sake)
2. Belize
2. Venezuela
3. Colombia
4. All Caribbean states
